# Product-Insight-Generator
This application is meant to serve as a one-stop site where consumers can input the name of a product to verify whether or not it is worth the purchase. The app leverages generative AI using the OpenAI API to scrape the web for reliable reviews and return a summary of its key findings. Products are separated into four different categories: skincare, makeup, haircare, and clothing. Depending on the product type, the app will return a review based on different product qualities. For instance, for a skincare product, the result will be a summary on the product's sustainability, effectiveness, and compatability with varying skin types. The product qualities for each type of product are listed below. 
* Skincare: sustainability, effectiveness, compatability with varying skin types
* Makeup: sustainability, durability, quality
* Haircare: sustainability, effectiveness, compatability with varying hair types
* Clothing: sustainability, quality, suitability with different body types
